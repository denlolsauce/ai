# Image Reading AI
A work in progress user friendly AI model for predicting images

# Features
Trained on MNIST handwriting dataset. The starting menu of the program allows you to choose a batch size to train your model on. 
After you have trained your model you can use the RUN function using a custom image.

# How to use custom images
If you decide to draw an image or use a handwritten image off google you **must** centre it and add an adequate amount of space around the number.

After that save it as **image.png**
If the model guesses incorrectly its usually due to preprocessing errors

# Module needed

```pip install opencv-python``` ```pip install numpy``` ```pip install idx2numpy```  


# Work in Progress
Working on cropping images automatically and adding multiple numbers (e.g. reading 1890 by seperating into seperate numbers)
